              <p className="threejs-card-text">This React component creates a visually dynamic splash screen using **@react-three/fiber** and **@react-three/drei** to render a rotating, orbiting 3D sphere with embedded text. The `RotatingSphere` component uses a `ref` to directly manipulate the sphere's position and rotation in each frame, via the `useFrame` hook. The sphere continuously rotates on its X and Y axes while simultaneously orbiting around the center using trigonometric functions (`Math.sin` and `Math.cos`) based on the elapsed time, creating a smooth circular motion. A `Text` element reading **"ZXY"** is attached to the sphere, positioned offset on its surface, and rendered in red with beveling for emphasis. The `SplashScreen` component places the animation within a canvas that‚Äôs styled to sit near the vertical center of the viewport, using ambient and point lighting to illuminate the metallic sphere. This working code offers a clean, elegant 3D animation suitable for introductory branding or visual loading screens.

              <p className="threejs-card-text">This Vue.js component sets up a functioning 3D scene using **Three.js** and **Troika-Three-Text** to render animated 3D text within a browser. When the component is mounted, it initializes a scene with a perspective camera, a WebGL renderer, and a point light to illuminate the environment. The key feature is a rotating 3D text mesh that displays the phrase **"nyc sound guy"** in bright red, created using the `Text` class from Troika. The text is positioned slightly above the center and continuously rotates along the Y-axis in the animation loop, which is handled with `requestAnimationFrame`. The scene is appended to a container div, and all Three.js resources are properly disposed of in the `beforeUnmount` hook to prevent memory leaks. The implementation demonstrates a clean and efficient way to integrate animated 3D text into a Vue.js application using modern 3D web technologies.

              <p className="threejs-card-text">This React component defines a dynamic 3D scene using the @react-three/fiber and @react-three/drei libraries, which allow React developers to work seamlessly with Three.js. The main component, MovingObject1, renders a canvas that displays various 3D shapes (box, sphere, cylinder, torus) and animated text elements that move based on sine wave calculations, giving a lively, interactive feel. The Box1 component manages static 3D shapes and includes a rotating red box, while MovingText animates text objects ("nycpony") in different colors and motion patterns using the useFrame hook. The scene also includes environmental features like a Sky component and lighting (ambient and point light) to enhance realism. SetCanvasSize attempts to ensure the canvas fills the viewport, although its implementation may be unnecessary or buggy due to misuse of set. Overall, the code demonstrates how to build an animated, visually engaging 3D scene within a React app.</p>

              <p className="threejs-card-text">This React code creates a visually engaging 3D scene using `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei`, centered around two main animated components: a metallic sphere and a rotating torus. The `Sphere1` component animates a reflective sphere in a circular orbit, using trigonometric functions to update its position with each frame via the `useFrame` hook. It also displays the text ‚ÄúTTB‚Äù floating just in front of the sphere, enhancing its visual identity. The `Torus1` component adds a rotating orange torus at the center of the scene. The `MovingObject` component brings the scene together inside a canvas element styled with Tailwind CSS for responsive layout and a dark background. It includes lighting (a pink-tinted hemisphere light and a point light) and a dynamic starfield using the `Stars` component, adding depth and ambiance. The `OrbitControls` allows interactive camera movement, making the scene immersive and explorable. Overall, the code exemplifies a clean, modular approach to building animated 3D web visuals in React.
